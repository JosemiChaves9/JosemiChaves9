# Hi! I'm Josemi Chaves!

## Who am I? 🧑‍💻  
I am a decisive person, committed and passionate about what I do, organisation and planning are vital to me. I like challenges and facing them, although I also like to work in a team to solve them and give the best of me.  
  
## What do I like?  
I love the new technologies, from development, both web (web apps) and software and hardware (Arduino), and other technlogies such as 3D printing and CAD Design.  
  
In my spare time I spend my time playing and watching sports, my favourite sports are motor racing, and enjoying the natural life on the island where I live in beautiful Mallorca.

## What are my tech skills?
